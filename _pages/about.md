Hi there...!!!!

I am Aneesh M U and an electronics and computer engineer by profession. Currently I work at Tonbo Imaging as a Computer Vision Engineer creating embedded vision platforms and product development. I graduated with a Masters degree from International Instititue of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H) in VLSI and Computer Engineering. I am a curious learner, always up to date with latest technologies and passionate about FPGAs. 

This site is about technologies concerning FPGA, GPU, Computer Vision etc. which I am passionate about. In between, I might also post some random interesting stuff and probaly philosophy as well as I grow old. (Don't we all care about our purpose of life when we have ample time in hand as we grow older and develop some perspective !! :smiley:) Tutorials, code snippets and website recommendations are some of the things you can expect to find here.
